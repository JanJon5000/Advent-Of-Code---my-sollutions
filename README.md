# Advent of Code
<p>Its an initiative or a yearly organised challange - whatever you want to call it, it is a great way to learn a programming language basics and practice problem solving. You can check out the original site of the challenge and learn more about it and participate as well.<a href ="https://adventofcode.com/">Here</a> is the site of organisers</p>

## My battle with AOC challanges
<p> It started in 2023 when I was solving challanges in python. I couldnt solve all of them but had a lot of fun with trying. Today - 13 April 2025 i returned to it with a new idea. I will try to solve diffrent years' challanges with diffrent programming languages. Its propably not original but here is a list of what I at least started to solve and with which language and how it is going:</p>
